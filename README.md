# autism-detector-app
An autism detection app is a software application designed to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using machine learning models
and behavioral analysis. The app uses various techniques to gather data that can be used to identify potential indicators of ASD. The app works by asking a series of
questions related to the patient's behavior, communication, and social interaction. These questions are based on standardized screening questionnaires that are 
commonly used by healthcare professionals to assess the risk of ASD. The patient can answer these questions by selecting their responses.
The app also uses advanced machine learning algorithms to predict whether patient is suffering from autism or not.
